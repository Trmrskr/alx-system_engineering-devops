# 0x0F - Load Balancer

In this proejct, we improve our web stack so that there is reduncdancy for our web servers. This allows our servers to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.

Bash scripts were used to automate the works in this work.
